# Mandelbrot Exploder

A Mandelbrot set explorer written in Rust with real-time interaction and parallel processing.

## Features

- Interactive zooming and rotation
- Progressive detail refinement
- Parallel computation for calculations
- Window-resize handling
- 64-bit precision
- Escape-time visualization with orbit trap colouring

## Building

Requires the Rust toolchain.

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Usage

- Left click: Center on point
- Mouse wheel: Zoom
- Shift + mouse wheel: Rotate
- Window can be freely resized

## Implementation Details

The visualization uses:
- `winit` for window management
- `pixels` for frame buffer handling
- `rayon` for parallel computation
- `num_complex` for complex number math

Core components:
- Escape-time calculation with period checking
- Newton iteration for period calculation
- Orbit tracking for colour generation
- View transformation with coordinate remapping
- Progressive refinement during navigation
- Atomic counters for thread-safe progress tracking
